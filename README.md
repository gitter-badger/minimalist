### Lost Opportunities
_**Why not having something is bad.**_

Each hike has at least one specific panoramic view that I like to recall. The 2007 Alaska High Adventure Trip has snowy peaks of a distant mountain ridge parallel to the one we had just climbed. I cherish those snowy peaks, but I'm also mindful of the effort that came before. That climb was the culmination of 5 days of hiking with the level of preparation you can only get after 7 years of Boy Scout camp-outs. We required hand-pumped filters to replenish our Nalgenes with drinking water. We navigated across multiple fields of scree, loose and jagged boulders the result of physical weathering from glacial erosion, where our hiking poles ensured stable footing. With an Alaskan summer having 22 hours of daylight we used nightshades to keep a regular sleep cycle and energy levels high. Each item in our pack was thoughtful in it's purpose. And I'd like to maintain this level of thoughtfulness with all my belongings. Because wither in an emergency, daily routine, or whim each second is an opportunity for a moment of my life and the things I own determine my level of preparedness.

### Stoicism
_**A philosophy for peaceful contentedness.**_

Seneca, author of the seneca letters, taught Stoicism as a philosophy for the common man in search of "moral and intellectual perfection". Arguable his most influential letters were correspondence between friends across the Graeco-Roman world who were also practicing Stoicism. In my readings I found three specific lessons that applied to the ownership of stuff. First, to avoid hording because "nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in mere passing". Second, to not give way to jealousy for "it is not the man who has too little who is poor but the man who hankers for more". Third, to consider the limit of wealth to be "having what is essential, and then, having what is enough". In addition, and perhaps more important, is the recurring counsel towards deliberate nurturing of friendships. Therefore a physical thing could best be held up and valued by which it strengthens or weakens those relationships.
